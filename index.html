      <h1>Hi! My name is Iranique Martin</h1>
      <p>I am on the road to becoming software developer, and I reside in Miami, Florida.</p>
        <p>As a former medical student, I'm  very interested in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating projects that tie into the world of medicine.</li>
          <li>Discovering all of the different ways to code.</li>

    <!-- About Me -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="border-top">About Iranique</h2>
        <p>After graduating highschool and earning licensing as a LPN and EKG technician, I went on to college where I began my studies in biology. I was very much interested in medicine for the people, but I began to realize I had an additional passion that I was not fulfilling. That's when I began my journey to software development. I began small by working in a local cell repair shop and moved on to being a technical support specialist as well as a patient representative for my local hospital. </p>

        <p>As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I'm one step closer on my journey to becoming a software developer and I love it!</p>

        <p>I additionally have a passion for exercise, cooking, and reading a good book. Staying connected with all of my passions keep me very grounded. I often get asked by coworkers how I'm always calm in the workplace, and these are my methods!</p>

        <p>If you're looking to hire a diverse and eager junior developer, feel free to contact me. I'd be honored to be apart of any great  and growing teams.</p>
